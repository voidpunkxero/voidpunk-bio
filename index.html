  <h2>Welcome to the Void</h2>

  <p>Once a respected keyboard mercenary in the content mines, I spent over 15 years selling tactical flashlights, dubious water filters, and “EMP-proof” Mylar burritos to gun-toting doomsday preppers who wouldn't last twenty minutes after a North Korean grid zap. It was decent money—until it wasn't. Rates plummeted, the gig economy turned into a hostage situation, and I realized I had neither the patience for “creative” brainstorms nor the stomach for another Slack thread about synergy.</p>

  <p>So I did what any disaffected, results-driven man of a certain age would do: I nuked the past and started learning to code.</p>

  <p>Enter <strong>VoidPunkXero</strong>: my final form, forged in the glowing green text of early-90s BBS systems and steeped in dystopian sci-fi where the corporations win and the hackers get the punchlines. I've always loved logic, structure, and the thrill of breaking things just to put them back together again. Web dev scratched the itch. And unlike in 1991, I’ve now got a secret weapon: Chatty, my AI sidekick who patiently helps me make sense of Flexbox when my brain short-circuits, and Max Flow, my human counterpart who told me, “Dude, just do it. Worst case, you're still smarter than most people doing it already.”</p>

  <p>Right now I'm learning front-end development and the basics of LABS stacks. It's going better than expected, mostly because I no longer have to memorize syntax like some digital ascetic—Chatty can conjure up scaffolding at will, and I just patch in the haunted HTML myself.</p>

  <p>This isn't a portfolio. It's a warning. Or maybe a cry for help. Either way, the system is online.</p>

  <p>And yes, I know the cursor is blinking. It's supposed to be that way. I'm not a monster.</p>

  <h2>A Man Of Culture</h2>
  <p>When I'm not hexing HTML or coaxing Flexbox into obedience, I waste time in the following extremely productive ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Japanese Pro Wrestling (circa 1988):</strong> Preferably when someone gets dropped directly on their neck and the crowd reacts with polite, horrified clapping.</li>
    <li><strong>Harsh Noise & Death Industrial:</strong> The kind of music that sounds like a cement mixer full of bones, preferably played at volumes that annoy the neighbors I don't talk to.</li>
    <li><strong>Being a Dad:</strong> Actual joy. No irony. Just trying to make sure my kid stays a kid a little longer in a world built to crush that out early.</li>
    <li><strong>Collecting Forgotten Media:</strong> Shot-on-video horror, sleazy VHS slashers, and 80s sci-fi that probably got someone fired. Especially fond of movies where the hacker dies for saying too much.</li>
    <li><strong>Torturing Photographs:</strong> If J.G. Ballard built a website, it might look like my sketchbook.</li>
    <li><strong>Fueling the Machine:</strong> Coffee and Rogue pouches in an endless Cold War truce. No alcohol, no drugs, just enough stimulants to keep things interesting.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I'm not trying to build a brand. I'm just leaking signal.</p>
