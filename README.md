# voidpunk-bio

A personal HTML/CSS project built as part of Week 1 in a self-directed front-end development bootcamp. This is the digital calling card of **VoidPunkXero** — a relic of the early-90s BBS underground reanimated with Flexbox and neon green code.

## 📟 What Is This?

This is not a portfolio. It’s a warning.

Themed after old-school CRT terminals, this static site introduces:

- A terminal-style hacker persona
- ASCII art headers
- Command log simulators
- System boot messages
- A blinking cursor (because yes, it _has_ to blink)

All done with semantic HTML and raw CSS — no frameworks, no JavaScript, just haunted markup.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- **HTML5** — semantic, structured, accessible
- **CSS3** — custom font, Flexbox layout, keyframe animations
- **Google Fonts** — Share Tech Mono for that proper retro punch
- **ASCII Art** — rendered using `<pre>` blocks for maximum BBS authenticity

---

## 🧪 Features

- Blinking cursor animation via `@keyframes`
- Responsive flex layout (desktop first)
- Fake system logs and inline command syntax
- Styled `<pre>` and `<code>` blocks
- Just enough sarcasm and existential dread

## 🧠 Creator

Built by **VoidPunkXero** — former copywriter turned codepunk.  
Fueled by black coffee, nicotine pouches, and disappointment in capitalism.

Inspired by:

- BBS culture
- Dystopian sci-fi
- The horrifying realization that everything is now ad tech
